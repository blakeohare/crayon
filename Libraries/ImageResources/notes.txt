There is a manifest that declares all image resources, where they are, and how they are loaded.

Image sheets are created by aggregating a bunch of images together (as defined by the build file)
and separating them into logical chunks (sprite sheets). Each of these chunks can further be
partitioned into indivdiual downloadable tiles. The tiles are then aggregated after they are all
loaded and you have a series of chunks.

A sheet is made of chunks which are made of tiles.
Files are either standalone or exist in a sheet.
The notion of chunks and tiles are never exposed to the end user. 
This makes downloading go faster if you have tons of small images and also you can expose
download progress to the user in the form of a progress bar.

The manifest itself is a series of lines. Each line is a set of comma delimited values.
The first value is a letter...

--A--
Declares a single standalone file, its generated resource name, and its original
user-facing name.
"A, gen-filename, width, height, filename"

--S--
Declares an image sheet. This sheet then becomes the "active sheet".
"S, Sheet ID, name" 

--C--
Declares a chunk in the active sheet.
This then becomes the "active chunk"
Note: If the width and height are 0,0 then it is actually a 1024x1024 sheet which is the 
most common size.
"C, width, height"

--T--
Tile. Declares a physical image file in the active chunk.
"T, gen-filename, x, y, width, height, bytes"

--I--
Declares an image in the active chunk.
"I, x, y, width, height, filename"

--J--
A JPEG chunk/image. JPEG has fuzzy artifacts and will spill into adjoining images if composed
into a sheet. By using a high quality compression and padding images by extending the border 
pixels outward, it may be possible to aggregate them into a real sheet, though.
TODO: For games it's not a big deal that JPEGs are handled in this wonky way since JPEGs tend 
to be used for large purposes such as background that would be their own chunk anyway, but for
general purposes, this assumption will be less true and so they should be composited eventually.
"J, gen-filename, width, height, bytes, filename"

The manifest class has the following lookup datastructure that is generated from the above manifest...

resourceInfo is a dictionary of user-facing filenames to information of where files come from 
and dimension info.
{
	filename1: [ImgResourceType.STANDALONE, gen-filename, width, height]
	filename2: [ImgResourceType.SHEET, sheet ID, chunk ID, x, y, width, height]
	...
}

sheetInfo is a lookup of sheet information based on sheet ID...
{
	<SHEET ID>: {
		name: <NAME>
		chunks: {
			<CHUNK ID>: {
				width: <WIDTH>
				height: <HEIGHT>
				tiles: [
					[<GENERATED FILENAME>, <X>, <Y>, <WIDTH>, <HEIGHT>, <BYTES>],
					...
				]
			}
		}
	}
}


TODO: will need to double-buffer the render pipeline so that synchronous loadFromResource 
will not do weird things to the screen.

User code:

imageLoader = ImageLoader.loadFromResourceAsync("my file.png");
imageLoader = ImageLoader.loadFromResource("my file.png");
...
imageLoader.isDone();
imageLoader.getImage();

sheet = ImageSheetLoader.fromIdsAsync(["sprites", "tiles"]);
sheet = ImageSheetLoader.fromIds(["sprites", "tiles"]);
...
sheet.isDone();
img = sheet.getImage("foo.png");
members = sheet.getFiles();
...

immutableTexture = GFX.loadTextureFromImage(img);

There are two classes that represent a native image: NativeImageResource and Image.
NativeImageResource is generally not exposed to the user.

NativeImageResource
- nativeData[0] -> native bitmap data (System.Drawing.Image/canavs/pygame.Surface/java.awt.BufferedImage/etc)
- width - width and height of the native resource.
- height
- revision ID -- counter that starts at 0 for each resource ID and increments each time it is modified.
- resource ID -- globally unique ID
- resourceFingerprint - above two fields as a string for use as a quick key comparison.
- .clone() -- creates a copy of this data with a new resource ID, with a rev ID of 0. 
- .blit(image, x, y) -- draw another image onto this one without creating a resource copy or incrementing revision ID.
- isLocked -- can't use this unless this is false
- .lock() -- prevent using this aside from blit. increments the revision ID and makes a copy.
- .unlock() -- sets the isLocked bit to false.

Image
- res -- a reference to the NativeImageResource
- x -- x and y coordinates within the NativeImageResource
- y
- width -- width and height within the NativeImageResource
- height
- .clone() -- will create a individual copy of native resource of just the section covered by this image

GfxTextureResource
- nativeData[0] - boolean if this is GL based
- nativeData[1] - a copy of the actual native image resource
	for GL platforms -> this is a power-of-2 sized image
	for non-GL -> this is just a simple image of just 1 image
- nativeData[2] - width
- nativeData[3] - height
- nativeData[4] - texture ID (GL only)
- width
- height

GfxTexture
- nativeData[0 - 3] - texture left, top, right, bottom
- gfxTextureResource
- resourceX - where in the resource this image is
- resourceY
- width - width and height of just this image within the sheet
- height

GfxTextureDatabase (static lookup dictionary on GfxTextureResource)
- Dictionary<resourceVersionKey, gfxTextureResource> loadedResources

PixelSession
- create a transaction session object
-- this creates a temporary image object that's a copy of just the pixels being edited
- flush the session to the original image will increment the revision ID
-- Image objects will be updated
-- GfxTextures will not.
