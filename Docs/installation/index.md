# Installation

## Windows Setup

- Download the Zip file from the [Download Page](http://crayonlang.org/download).
- Extract it.
- Place the contents in a directory like **C:\Crayon**
- Create an environment variable called **CRAYON_HOME** that points to this directory. This should be the directory such that **%CRAYON_HOME%\crayon.exe** is a valid path.
- Add **;%CRAYON_HOME%** to the end of the **PATH** environment variable. The semicolon is not a typo. It is a delimiter for PATH items.
- Restart any command line windows to pick up the new environment variables.

You are now ready to run Crayon from the command line.
