# Using the Command Line

You're probably here because one of the tutorials told you to "go to a such-and-such folder and run a command in the command line". You probably want to get back to that tutorial as quick as possible, so this will be pretty to-the-point.

The command line goes by a few names. In Windows it is often referred to as the "Command Prompt" and in OSX and other Unix/Linux-based systems, it's often referred to as the terminal or the shell. Either way, they mostly behave the same way and do the same things. I've included instructions for both.
